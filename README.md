*note:* One of my subs pointed out that the original implementation of this application had a infinite loop in it.  While this loop is not problematic; it still isn't a great practice.  On this sub's advice, I also added a version of this code which uses streams to fetch the data from the shared prefs key/value store.  There is both a basic dart example and an RxDart example; just make sure to import RxDart if you want to look at that one.
